                    <p class="long_text">
                    Hello, my name is Simon and I'm a landlord with over 10 years of experience in the industry.
                    I saw how rental properties could provide a steady stream of income and long-term financial stability, and I knew I wanted to get involved.
                    </p>  
                    <p class="long_text">
                    Over the years, I've learned a lot about what it takes to be a successful landlord.
                    One of the most important things is communication. I make it a priority to maintain open lines of communication with my tenants, so that they always know they can come to me with any concerns or issues.
                    This has helped me build strong, long-lasting relationships with my renters, which in turn has led to high occupancy rates and a low turnover rate.
                    </p>
                    <p class="long_text"> 
                    Another key to being a successful landlord is staying on top of maintenance and repairs.
                    I have a network of reliable contractors and vendors that I work with, and I always make sure to address any issues as soon as they arise.
                    This helps keep my properties in top condition, which in turn attracts quality tenants and helps me maintain a solid reputation in the community.
                    </p>
                    <p class="long_text">
                    Being a landlord can be challenging at times, but it's also incredibly rewarding.
                    I take pride in providing safe, comfortable homes for my tenants, and I love seeing themthrive in the spaces I've created.
                    I also appreciate the financial benefits of owning rental properties, which have allowed me to achieve a level of financial freedom that I never thought possible.
                    In addition to my experience as a landlord, I also stay up-to-date on industry trends and best practices.
                    I attend conferences and workshops, and I'm an active member of several landlord associations.
                    This helps me stay informed about changes to local laws and regulations, as well as new technologies and tools that can help me better serve my tenants.
                    </p>
                    <p class="long_text">
                    Overall, I'm a dedicated and experienced landlord who takes pride in providing quality rental properties and excellent customer service.
                    I believe that being a landlord is about more than just collecting rent - it's about creating a sense of community and providing a safe, comfortable home for the people who live in my properties.
