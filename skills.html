               <p class="long_text">
                  A successful house landlord must also have a good understanding of local and state laws and regulations related to rental properties.
                  This includes knowledge of fair housing laws, building codes, and landlord-tenant laws.
                  It's important for landlords to stay up-to-date on any changes to these laws and regulations to ensure they are in compliance and avoid anylegal issues.
               </p>
               <p class="long_text">

                  This requires the ability to remain calm and level-headed in stressful situations, and to come up with creative solutions that satisfy all parties involved.
               </p>
               <p class="long_text">
                  In addition to these skills, a successful house landlord must also possess a strong work ethic and be committed to providing quality customer service to their tenants.
                  This means being responsive to tenant needs, maintaining properties in good condition, and providing a safe and comfortable living environment.
               </p>
               <p class="long_text">
